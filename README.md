1.	Abstract


In this bustling of life, everyone needs different entertainment areas to make life spend easier. 
On the other hand, the cryptocurrency is very interesting not only in terms of blockchain technology but also making income for everyone. 
Therefore, we decide to combine these things together and we generate 808TA token to satisfy all.


2.	Introduction 808TA Token

808TA token is a standard ERC-20 token and based on ETH network. Ethereum smart contracts execute the financial transfers of 808TA token and all sub-tokens. They are driven by all events from the 808TA token and all sub-tokens.

808TA is also supported by a lot of wallets such as: MetaMask, Trust Wallet, MEW wallet, Enjin wallet,... Therefore, people can manage their assets easily with only one interface.

Our plan is making 808TA become a central token with many other sub-tokens. Each sub-token will be used on specific decentralized application (Dapp). And 808TA will become the main token that generate all sub-tokens through staking 808TA progress.

These things will make our 808TA Ecosystem bigger day by day without any inflation, more secure and fast.

And we also need a large amount of 808TA for all passions we aim:
•	Payment method.
•	Trading on Exchange.
•	Game Dapp, Entertainment Dapp.
•	Betting platform.
